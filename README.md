## Description
### For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. So I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
### 

## Installation
### To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm install, npm install express
```
## Usage
### - Application should allow users to create and save notes.
### - Application should allow users to view previously saved notes.
### - Application should allow users to delete previously saved notes.

## Tests
### To run tests, run the following command: 
 ``` 
server.js
 ```
